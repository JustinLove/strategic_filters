# Strategic Filters

Selectively disable classes of strategic icons.

## Default Keybindings

- Toggle surface: ctrl+shift+i
- Toggle air: ctrl+shift+o
- Toggle orbital: ctrl+shift+p

Alternate suggestions welcome, but keep in mind there may be many more in the future

## Dependencies

[Blueprint Info Framework](https://forums.uberent.com/threads/rel-blueprint-info-framework-v1-4-4.56213/)

## Future work

- Focus modes - enable certain icons and disable all others (suggestions?)
- Extract a framework for communicating with the icon atlases.
